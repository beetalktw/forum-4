{"forum": {"content": "Hi, I'm Sam.<br />I have been in Taiwan for a while already but am now looking for some new activity partners around Taipei.  I am not trying to find language exchange here so we can exclusively chat in English.  This also means that, although I have a natural predilection towards teaching (and explaining), I won't treat you like a student and I won't take a lot of effort to teach you new things unless it's holding back the conversation or opening the door for confusion.<br />Sounds good so far?<br /><br />I like hiking, swimming, ubiking, and relaxing in nature.  Preferably while talking about something deep and engaging (Politics, Philosophy, Sociology, Health).  I don't know much about economics but if you do I would like to hear about it so that's a bonus.  Also hoping to find someone who is able to drive the conversation sometimes so I don't have to do all the 'heavy lifting'.<br /><br />Oh yeah....and let's avoid the same 10 starter questions that get asked every single time.  I value original and unorthodox thought and conversations.  That doesn't mean I will reject you if you ask the questions...but it makes for dull conversation.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/f040bf27437ba448272069a2068a1c69", "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/d2d5b8add1817df985c361d3a7ed82d1"], "urls": [], "title": "Activity partner."}, "threadStatus": 1, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1467520447000, "level": 2, "location": "Taipei City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/5070672755382506920", "name": "Sol"}, "id": 4037848}
