{"forum": {"content": "As the title, I'm looking for somebody to chat in English by phone call. The purpose is nothing but practicing speaking.<br />In fact, my English speaking is not frequent, that's why I'm here. What I have is only courage.<br />I like exercise, especially triathlon. On the other hand, I keep some enthusiasm in graphic design and illustrator. I like travel, having been to Japan, UK, France, Thailand... These are my basic info. <br />If you want to get the next step and share something with me, just add me as friend with your purpose. <br />Maybe we can set some topic, subjects in advance, and prepare some words to chat in the phone. That would be better for both of us   :)<br /><br />*If you only want to improve English writing ... that's ok, but time is limit so maybe the response wouldn't be in a rapid time. <br /><br />Anyway, nice to meet you~ be free at home!", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/0ce8e308ffb612938dcd48feba006e41"], "urls": [], "title": "Looking for English speaker"}, "threadStatus": 1, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1468697958000, "level": 1, "location": "Miaoli County\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-5656434265511206087", "name": "Gilbe"}, "id": 4120959}
