I came back to Taiwan because I have to do my military service for a year, which I think it's a complete waste of time but anyways, my point is I need to make some friends in Taiwan, in return we can practice English; we can even hang out if you like. <br /><br />Thanks for your time, <br />Billy.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/03c282deb86d2daa5a07bfb566e34709"], "urls": [], "title": "In need of some friends"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1474701967000, "level": 3, "location": "New Taipei City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/9020304353823255296", "name": "Billy"}, "id": 4560252}
